# LLT Features
A project on the limb lateralization task while recording EEG from the [BrainCNF Group](https://uol.de/psychologie/neurokfn)  at the University of Oldenburg
<br>

## Project description
Motor imagery based limb rotation done by three groups (Healthy older adults, Stroke patients, Healthy younger adults). Recorded EEG data is analysed based on [Braun ea., 2017](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/np/2017/4653256/) & [Debener ea., 2005](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/25/50/11730.short)
